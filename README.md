# FolderStructureDuplicator

Duplicates a folder structure to another folder.\n
This soft was used to test others tools such as the [SortFolders](https://github.com/bGrisafi/SortFolders) tool, without using actual meaningfull folders.

Note that this tool olny duplicates the first layer of the subfolders. As example, a folder "myFolder" containing a "subFolder" that contains itself a "subSubFolder" folder.
Using this tool on the "myFolder" folder will only duplicate the "subFolder" folder, not the "subSubFolder" folder inside the "subFolder" folder.
